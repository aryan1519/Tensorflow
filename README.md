# Tesorflow

This contains a series of notebooks which cover basics of using Tensorflow.

It covers use of Tensorflow for creating Neural Networks for regression and classifications problems.
and covers importants concepts and good practices to use while building a model.

Transfer Learning using Tensorflow is discussed in detail.

There are notebooks on use of Tensorflow for data analysis problems,
computer vision problems and natural language processing problems.

Time Series notebooks will be added later.
